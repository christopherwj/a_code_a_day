A code a day repository:

Hello and welcome to my  repo where I try and consistently  push new code or new iterations of code daily. 
The main purpose of this repo is to keep me thinking about code, problem solving, algorithms, and learning new things I didn't know before about coding.
I hope to better my craft by constantly putting myself in a position where I am thinking in code and using/learning best practices. 
So far the benefits have been outstanding. I constantly find these problems and code circulating about in my head with potential improvements, break throughs in methodology, and gains in efficiency. I hope that through keeping this habbit for years to come, that I can gain a solid hold on programming and better my critical problem solving skills in all realms of life.
