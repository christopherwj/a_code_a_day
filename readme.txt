A code a day repository:

Hello and welcome to my personal repo where I try and consistantly push new code or iterations of code daily. 
The main purpose of this repo is to keep me thinking about code and it's nuances in practice.
I hope to better my craft by constantly putting myself in a position where I am thinking in code and using/learning best practices. 
So far the benefits have been outstanding. I constantly find these problems and code circulating about in my head with potential improvements, break throughs in methodology, and gains in efficiency. I hope that through keeping this habbit for years to come, that I can gain a solid hold on programming and better my critical problem solving skills in all realms of life.
