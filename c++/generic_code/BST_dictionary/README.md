Binary Search Tree

Using a binary search tree, you are tasked with building a dictionary program which you can store a word with its definition.  Each node of the tree will contain the word and definition. The word is what will be used as the key to sort our data.

The dictionary should allow you to search for a word. If the word exist then the definition will display. You can also add words to the dictionary. For testing you should be able to display the current word list.

The dictionary will populate from a data file and new words will be saved to the file as well.
